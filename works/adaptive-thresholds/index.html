        <div class="description-content"><p>Behind where I live, there is a small, unassuming hill. At its summit scatter a few villages, while the foot of the hill is lined with residential compounds built for factory workers. Perhaps owing to an innate human attachment to the land, the villagers still cling to their modest wheat fields and orchards. Meanwhile, those at the base of the hill—long accustomed to concrete beneath their feet—persist in carving out small, sporadic vegetable plots along the slopes.</p><p>What guards these patches of cultivated land are an assortment of makeshift gates and fences. Some are rudimentary constructions of foraged dead branches, haphazardly lashed together into something resembling a gate. Others are slightly more structured—grids of wooden slats crisscrossed and bound with wire. Then there are those fashioned from discarded door panels, anchored to a wooden stake or concrete post to serve as a barrier. A few even resemble proper gates: aluminum grilles or purpose-built wire mesh enclosures.</p><p>To me, each of these gates is a reflection of the person who built it. Every individual, working within their own constraints and opportunities, has adapted to their circumstances—selecting whatever materials were at hand to fashion a gate that embodies their intentions. Behind these gates, the crops are tended by a variety of hands. Perhaps it’s a local farmer from one of the villages. Or maybe it’s someone who has since moved into an apartment but still finds solace in turning the soil. It could even be someone like my parents, who spent their youth in the countryside and now, in retirement, unconsciously project those memories onto the present. And then there are those who do it simply to pass the time in retirement, all while enjoying the fruits—or vegetables—of their labor.</p></div>
